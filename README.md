# vue-intl-pluralization-check

> A Vue.js project, example for issue with pluralization.

Issue: `$formatMessage` doesn't provide correct pluralization. Numbers which should be mapped as `two`, `few` and `many` are mapped to `other`.


## How to run

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/fend25/vue-intl-pluralization-check.git
cd vue-intl-pluralization-check
yarn
npm start
```
